                        The automotive industry is a wide range of companies and organizations involved in the design, development, manufacturing,<br>
                        marketing, and selling of motor vehicles, some of them are called automakers. It is one of the world's most important<br> 
                        economic sectors by revenue. The automotive industry does not include industries dedicated to the maintenance of automobiles<br>
                        following delivery to the end-user, such as automobile repair shops and motor fuel filling stations.

                        The automotive industry began in the 1860s with hundreds of manufacturers that pioneered the horseless carriage. For many<br>
                        decades, the United States led the world in total automobile production. In 1929, before the Great Depression, the world<br>
                        had 32,028,500 automobiles in use, and the U.S. automobile industry produced over 90% of them. At that time the U.S. had<br>
                        one car per 4.87 persons. After World War II, the U.S. produced about 75 percent of world's auto production. In 1980,<br>
                        the U.S. was overtaken by Japan and then became world's leader again in 1994. In 2006, Japan narrowly passed the U.S in<br>
                        production and held this rank until 2009, when China took the top spot with 13.8 million units. With 19.3 million units<br>
                        manufactured in 2012, China almost doubled the U.S. production, with 10.3 million units, while Japan was in third place<br>
                        with 9.9 million units. From 1970 (140 models) over 1998 (260 models) to 2012 (684 models), the number of automobile<br>
                        models in the U.S. has grown exponentially.

                        Safety in the automotive industry is particularly important and therefore highly regulated. Automobiles and other motor<br>
                        vehicles have to comply with a certain number of norms and regulations, whether local or international, in order to be<br>
                        accepted on the market. The standard ISO 26262, is considered as one of the best practice framework for achieving automotive<br>
                        functional safety.
